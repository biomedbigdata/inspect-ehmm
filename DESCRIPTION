Description: eHMM (enhancer Hidden Markov Model) is a software for
	genome-wide enhancer prediction based on the state of the chromatin.
	It uses an updated framework of EpiCSeg (Mammana et al., 2015) which provides
    tools for extracting count data from BAM files, typlically corresponding
    to ChIP-seq experiments for histone marks (but other choices are possible)
    learns a statistical model for the read counts based on a HMM, and provides
	tools for displaying and analyzing the obtained models and segmentations.
	eHMM learns an unsupervised background model as well as two foreground models
	based on training sets for enhancers and promoters, thereby distinguishing
	between the two. eHMM can also be used with pretrained models.
	eHMM can be used as an R package or from the command line via Rscript.
